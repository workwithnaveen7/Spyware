# Spyware Project

This project is a basic keylogger and system information retriever that logs keystrokes, captures clipboard data, takes screenshots, and gathers basic system information. The data is stored locally on the user's machine.

## Features

- **Keylogger**: Records all keystrokes and stores them in a text file (`keystrokes_logs.txt`).
- **System Information**: Collects basic information about the system such as IP address, processor, system type, release version, and host name, and saves it in an Excel file (`computer_info.xlsx`).
- **Clipboard Data**: Retrieves the current clipboard content and logs it with a timestamp (`clipboard.txt`).
- **Screenshots**: Takes a screenshot of the current screen and saves it as an image file (`screenshot.png`).

## Note

This project is intended for educational purposes only. Using keyloggers or any form of spyware without consent is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission to monitor a system.
